/*!
 This module handles the communication of EDID structure with PC and monitor /
 projector. It contains two sub-modules and one sequential logic block.

 When the hpd_lcd of the monitor is triggered, the EDID data is read from the
 monitor using the edidmaster block. While reading the EDID data, we determine
 if the monitor supports DVI or HDMI modes and set dvi_only signal.

 During reading the EDID from the monitor, we pull the hpd_pc signal low,
 "disconnecting" the HDMI2USB from the PC. Once the EDID is read from the
 monitor, the hpd_pc is again pulled high and the PC will initiate I2C
 communication with the FPGA to read the EDID data.
